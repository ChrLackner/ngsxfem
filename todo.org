* cutting/decomposition/numint rules
** rename / move xfem-content: 
*** rename npxtest to npcutinttest
** add possibility to neglect POS/NEG/IF for NumIntStrategy
** helper functions to transform normals / space-time normals / nu
** rethink use of PointContainer (use it more / less?)
** more timing
** more advanced (faster) CheckIfCut strategies
** 4D - implementation...

* stx-visualization
** output to other format ... (tikz ?)... 

* XFESpace: 
** Update is called three times (just once is needed)..

* solveinstatx
** move diffop_impl.hpp include to correct location
** test cases...
** error calculation outputs error field (at least piecewise constant)

* condition number stuff (finish... ) 

* streamline diffusion
** implement space-time x version.... 

* stationary stokes test case...
** start with that
